# Libft project
## a project to code functions from scratch. 
All 42 students are usually not allowed to use any non-mandatory function including printf. Therefore, this is an important step to take into 42 world! <br>
I don't have the subject file but basicly the functions work as its name. It the name sound like some function from library such as string.h or stdio.h, that's right, we have to mimic the behavior of
those functions.
Some function are required to be made without any reference function, though.
For this project, I got full mark, so all can be references.
Anyway, I think one might crash or causes warning if is run on linux not mac, so be careful. But yeah, you know what to do. See the logic not the code. <br>
Good luck!
